\title{Extract Codon-Aligned Nucleotide MSA Windows}
\usage{
.extract_msa_subsets(msa, codon_patches)
}
\arguments{
\item{msa}{A nucleotide multiple sequence alignment in matrix form (e.g., from \code{ape::as.DNAbin()}).}

\item{codon_patches}{A data frame with \code{codon_patch} and \code{msa_subset_id} columns (from \code{.map_patches_to_codons()}).}
}
\value{
A named list of nucleotide MSA subsets, each a matrix corresponding to one patch.
}
\description{
Subsets a nucleotide multiple sequence alignment based on codon-level patches
derived from 3D structural neighborhoods. Each subset corresponds to a structural patch.
}
\details{
Assumes codon numbering starts at 1, with codon 1 = positions 1:3 in the MSA, codon 2 = 4:6, etc.
Used internally to extract windows for diversity and selection analysis.
