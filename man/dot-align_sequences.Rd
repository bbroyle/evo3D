\title{Align Reference and PDB Sequences}
\usage{
.align_sequences(sequences, user_supplied_alignment = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequences}{A named character vector of two protein sequences: the reference first, the structure-derived second.}

\item{user_supplied_alignment}{Placeholder for pre-aligned input (currently unused).}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\describe{
  \item{aln_mat}{Character matrix of aligned sequences.}
  \item{coverage}{Named list of coverage ranges for each sequence.}
}
}
\description{
Aligns a pair of amino acid sequences using ClustalOmega (via the \pkg{msa} package),
computes positional mismatches, and summarizes coverage across the alignment.
}
\details{
Used internally to align MSA or PDB-derived sequences to a reference
