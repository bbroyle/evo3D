\title{Calculate Aligned Coverage Ranges}
\usage{
.calculate_coverage(aln_mat, mismatch)
}
\arguments{
\item{aln_mat}{A character matrix representing a sequence alignment (rows = sequences, columns = positions).}

\item{mismatch}{Optional numeric vector of mismatch positions to summarize (e.g., from sequence comparison).}
}
\value{
A named list. Each element is a character vector of ranges for a sequence (e.g., \code{"5:25"}), plus an optional \code{mismatch} element.
}
\description{
Identifies contiguous non-gap regions in each sequence of an alignment matrix and formats them as range strings.
Optionally includes ranges of mismatched positions between aligned sequences.
}
\details{
Called by \code{.align_sequences()}.
