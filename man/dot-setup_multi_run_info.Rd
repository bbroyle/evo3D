\title{Setup evo3D Multi-Run Grid}
\usage{
.setup_multi_run_info(msa, pdb, chain, interface_chain, occlusion_chain)
}
\arguments{
\item{msa}{A single MSA (file path, matrix, or fasta object) or a list of such inputs.}

\item{pdb}{A single PDB (bio3d object) or a list of PDBs.}

\item{chain}{Main chain(s) of interest. Can be a character, vector, or nested list (e.g. \code{"A"}, \code{c("A","B")}, or \code{list(c("A","B"), "C")}).}

\item{interface_chain}{Chains to use for interface calculations. Can be \code{"all"}, a character vector, or list.}

\item{occlusion_chain}{Chains to use for occlusion in RSA/SASA. Same input rules as \code{interface_chain}.}
}
\value{
A list with standardized inputs and a \code{run_grid} data frame detailing each MSA–PDB–chain combination.
}
\description{
Expands combinations of MSA and PDB inputs into a run grid for multi-model, multi-chain evo3D analyses.
Automatically handles chain assignment and resolves homomultimer expansion where applicable.
