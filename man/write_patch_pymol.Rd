\title{Generate PyMOL Selection and Coloring Commands for Structural Patches}
\usage{
write_patch_pymol(patches)
}
\arguments{
\item{patches}{A data frame containing at least \code{patch} (residue groups, formatted as "residue_chain") and \code{residue_id} columns.}
}
\value{
A named list of character vectors:
\describe{
  \item{patches}{PyMOL \code{select} statements for each structural patch.}
  \item{colors}{PyMOL \code{color} commands to visually differentiate patches.}
  \item{centroid}{A \code{select} and \code{color} command to highlight centroid residues in black.}
}
}
\description{
Converts structural residue patches into PyMOL command strings for selection, coloring, and centroid annotation.
Each patch is assigned a unique selection (e.g., \code{patch_1}) and a randomly shuffled color.
}
\details{
These commands can be copied directly into a PyMOL session to visualize surface patches and their centroids.
